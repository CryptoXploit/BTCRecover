# Usage Examples

This page provides links to a number of examples tht demonstrate how the setup and syntax to use BTCRecover in a number of different recovery scenarios. (Generally with a corresponding YouTube video)

The commands given can be pretty much copy/pasted as-is to allow you to recreate the examples given in the YouTube video.

**Note:** Some changes may be required based on your platform, often simple things like using "python" vs "python3".

**Python Version:** Many of these videos were created using different forks of BTCRecover. The resources and commands here may differ slightly, but are designed to work with this fork under Python3.

python-progressbar
==================

An almost identical clone of the original python-progressbar by Nilton Volpato,
and available at:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2

This version only differs from the original in that it uses relative package
imports instead of absolute imports, which is necessary for the module to
work under Python 3.3.

## Installation

The module is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar33/2.4) 
so you just need to run:

````
pip install progressbar33
````

You can also install the latest version directly from github:

````
pip install git+https://github.com/germangh/python-progressbar
````
